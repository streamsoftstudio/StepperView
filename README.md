# StepperView

StepperView is a simple view that provides an interactive step-type progress bar to make it visually easier to keep track of the current position in the sequence of steps.

Integration:
StepperView supports importing of the library via SPM (Swift Package Manager).

You can add it from the Storyboard by applying a 'StepperView' class to a UIView element and selecting 'StepperView' module or programmatically by instantiating a StepperView class after adding import statement. 
'''Swift
import StepperView
'''
